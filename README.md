# Patient Manager Application

The following is a recreation of a patient manager application that I built for a clinic in the town of Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Guatemala while volunterring at the clinic.

Prior to this, all patient data was written out by hand, and it was common for patient files to become misplaced, or lost all together. In addition, writing out patient data by hand led to longer wait times for patients.

This simple application that I designed using Node.js and MongoDB allows workers at the clinic to enter the patient's name, date of birth, height, weight, and any symptoms they may be experiencing. 

Due to slow internet speeds and a limitied access to computers at the clinic, all styling for this application was kept as basic as possible, in order to ensure maximum efficiency and load times.

Since implementing this application, I have been notified by the doctor that wait times for patients have decreased, and no patient files have been lost since using my application.
